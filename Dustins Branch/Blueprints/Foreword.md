# Foreword

---

	First and foremost, I have written and created this book just for you. It's the only way I know how to really show you and tell you how much you mean to me.  
	
	I have had this overwhelming feeling that somewhere deep down, you might think that I don't care or that I don't love you but that couldn't be further from the truth.  
	
	You are all the best parts of me and a better version of me than I could ever be.  
	
	I feel as if Life dealt us a pretty unfair hand. In a sense that we have never really had the one on one time to fully bond with each other.  
	
	I don't hold anyone accountable except for myself for the things that I've done wrong.  
	
	Your mom made the right choice and the right decisions so her and Jason could give you the best life possible.  
	
	I couldn't see it back then but I see it now. I've been a mess and unstable it seems my entire adult life. I'm not a good role model and never have been. I am thankful that Jason stepped up and has been able to be all of the things I couldn't be. The same way my Dad did when my Biological Father decided he didn't want me.  
	
	I am not my biological father though. I would never abandon you. Though in some ways, maybe that's what it feels like to you.  
	
	Honestly, Jason is one of the only fathers on the planet that I have immense respect for. He's always been good to you and he's always been good to me. There are no hard feelings. No jealousy or resentment.
