# Time Diary

---


		If time travel is possible in the future
	and we were able to go back to a specific
	point in our lives whether it be to change
	something or relive our last moment with
	someone we lost.
	
	What if some of us have already traveled
	back to what we know now as the present
	day but in doing so our memories have no
	knowledge of who we were or what we did in
	the future, so we have no idea what it is
	we wanted to change or relive. That's one
	of the many jumbled thoughts my mind spits
	out at night when I can't sleep
