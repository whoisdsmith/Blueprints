## The Mirror Principle

---

- The Idea That Your Outer World Is Merely A Reflection Of Your Inner World.
- Most People Try To Manipulate The Reflection. Instead, Influence The Reflection Indirectly By Changing The Image You Present.

---

### LAW ONE

- The Mirror Reflects Relationship To Self And World.
	- If You Believe You're Not Good Enough, The Mirror Will Reflect This.
- The Mirror Will Always Confirm What You Believe To Be True About Your Identity And Paradigms.

#### Interrupt The Pattern

**Form Your Identity and Paradigms**

- Write Your Self-Views
- Write Your Paradigms

**Believe These To Be True!**

---

### LAW TWO

**The Reflection Is Formed With Delay**

- Stay with your assumption long enough to manifest.


---

### LAW THREE

**The Mirror Of Reality Does Not Reflect The Nature Of Your Thoughts, But The Pure Content Of It.**

- I.E. "'I Hate My Job" Will Result In More Things To Piss You Off In Your Job
- Glass Half Full

#### Notes

	This right here is how you apply what I wrote above. Instead of continuing too give in too old beliefs and ideas about life that bring you down, you use this to form your thoughts and beliefs that help you. For example, if you have the firm belief that something always stressed you out, change your thought too, “this is easy and I handle it with zero problems”. You have to feel it to be true however, and the greatest way is to catch yourself in a old belief and thought, step back and change that thought and feeling.
