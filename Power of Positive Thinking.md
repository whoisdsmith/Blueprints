#### Notes

	I find the best way too remove problems that seem to overbear you, is to love them. Every single one, and to visualize this problem, and to think of how these issues you deal with have the potential to better your life, in any way, shape, or form. No matter how stressful, how tedious, or painful these problems are, once you remove the negative feelings attached to them, they become opportunities rather than problems.
