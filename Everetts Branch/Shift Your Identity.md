## Shift Your Identity

---

- We Do Not Get What We Want, But Rather Who We Are.
- Dis-identify With The Ego, Reflect On What You Desire To Be And **CHOOSE** To Embody That.
- As Long As You Continue To Submit To Your Ego, You Will Stay Confined To It.  
Instead, Realize That You Can And Will Be What Your Heart And Soul Desires.
- Focus On Being, Rather Than Reforming.
- You **Donâ€™t** Have To Prove Yourself. Instead, Believe And Affirm.
- In Order To Achieve Something, First You Must Become.

### Notes

	We are all playing as characters, and we have the choice consciously too choose what that character is. Take some time too think about who you want too be and write it down. Then, embody that person as if you already are that person. How would this version of me think? How would this version of me respond to this situation? Dont focus on reforming because you are creating more problems than needed. Finally, feel it to be true, for feelings are the way you respond to your subconscious, and your subconscious is what makes this a reality.
