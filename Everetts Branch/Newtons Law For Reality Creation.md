### Notes

	The key to growth is understanding that without changing the underlying structure, (yourself) nothing will change. It will be a long and usually fruitless battle with yourself to change your habits, actions and patterns when you identify with them. Instead, start and end your day identifying who you wish to be, how you wish to think, how you wish to feel, and what not. Next, stop giving power to what bothers you. Your power = your awareness. The more you react and focus your awareness on the negative, the more it plays a part in your life. If you can be indifferent, or better yet love it, it will remove itself from your life.
