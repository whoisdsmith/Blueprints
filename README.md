## Building a Better Future

**Summary:** In order to create a better future, we must focus on sustainable development, technological advancements, social equity, and education. By prioritizing these four key areas, we can foster a world where the environment is preserved, the economy thrives, and all citizens have the opportunity to lead fulfilling lives.

- Sustainable Development: Implementing eco-friendly practices, such as renewable energy, green infrastructure, and sustainable agriculture, will help protect the planet and its resources for future generations. Collaboration between governments, businesses, and individuals is crucial to achieve global sustainability goals.
- Technological Advancements: Encouraging research and development in areas such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and renewable energy will drive economic growth and improve living standards. Supporting tech startups and fostering a culture of innovation will help ensure a prosperous future.
- Social Equity: Addressing inequality and fostering inclusivity are essential for a better future. By ensuring equal access to opportunities, resources, and decision-making power, we can create a more just society. This includes promoting diversity and equal representation in all sectors, as well as implementing policies that reduce wealth gaps and provide essential services to all citizens.
- Education: Investing in quality education for all will empower individuals to reach their full potential and contribute to society. This includes providing access to primary, secondary, and higher education, as well as promoting lifelong learning and vocational training. By nurturing critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills, we can cultivate a generation of global citizens ready to tackle the challenges of the future.
- Healthcare: Ensuring access to affordable and quality healthcare for all is vital for a better future. By investing in public health systems, promoting preventative care, and researching new treatments and vaccines, we can create healthier societies and reduce the burden of disease.
- Global Cooperation: Encouraging collaboration and open dialogue between nations will help address pressing global issues like climate change, poverty, and resource scarcity. By working together on international policies and initiatives, we can create a more stable and interconnected world.
- Responsible Governance: Strengthening democratic institutions and promoting transparency, accountability, and the rule of law will foster trust between citizens and their governments. By actively engaging citizens in the decision-making process and prioritizing the public interest, governments can ensure that policies are responsive to the needs of the population.
- Economic Resilience: Building a robust and diversified economy that can withstand global shocks is essential for long-term prosperity. By promoting entrepreneurship, supporting small and medium-sized businesses, and investing in infrastructure and research, we can create a more resilient economic landscape.
- Climate Action: Mitigating the effects of climate change and preparing for its impacts is critical for the well-being of both current and future generations. By adopting ambitious climate goals, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, and transitioning to low-carbon economies, we can minimize the harmful consequences of a changing climate.
- Community Engagement: Empowering communities to actively participate in the decision-making process and contribute to local initiatives will create a sense of shared responsibility and ownership. By nurturing grassroots movements and supporting community-driven projects, we can foster a more inclusive and participatory society.

By focusing on these ten key areas, we can create a comprehensive blueprint for building a better future that is sustainable, equitable, and prosperous for all. Collaboration and collective action are essential to achieving these ambitious goals and ensuring that the world we leave behind is one that future generations can be proud of.

### An ALTER EGO Could Change Your Life

---

### Power of Positive Thinking

![](PowerofPositiveThinkingQuotes.jpg)

---

#### Power of Positive Thinking - Quotes

**"There Is A Tendency In Human Nature To Become Precisely Like That Which You Habitually Imagine Yourself To Be"**

#### You Are What You Think About

**"Always Ask If Your Thoughts Deserve The Time, Attention, And Focus They Are  
Receiving.''**

---

##### Notes

	I find the best way too remove problems that seem to overbear you, is to love them. Every single one, and to visualize this problem, and to think of how these issues you deal with have the potential to better your life, in any way, shape, or form. No matter how stressful, how tedious, or painful these problems are, once you remove the negative feelings attached to them, they become opportunities rather than problems.

---

### Newtons Law For Reality Creation

![](NewtonsLawForRealityCreation.jpg)

---

**Realize**:

- Most People Try To Change Their Reality
- Focus = Energies

	Resistance <----> Desire

- When You Focus On Unwanted, You Give It Power And It Grows

**Solution**:

- Complete Acceptance of Your Current Reality
- Pure Focus on Your Desired Reality

**Stop Giving Focus To The Unwanted. Accept What Is And Shift To Desired.**

---

#### Notes

	The key to growth is understanding that without changing the underlying structure, (yourself) nothing will change. It will be a long and usually fruitless battle with yourself to change your habits, actions and patterns when you identify with them. Instead, start and end your day identifying who you wish to be, how you wish to think, how you wish to feel, and what not. Next, stop giving power to what bothers you. Your power = your awareness. The more you react and focus your awareness on the negative, the more it plays a part in your life. If you can be indifferent, or better yet love it, it will remove itself from your life. 

---

### Shift Your Identity

![](ShiftYourIdentity.jpg)

---

- We Do Not Get What We Want, But Rather Who We Are.
- Dis-identify With The Ego, Reflect On What You Desire To Be And **CHOOSE** To Embody That.
- As Long As You Continue To Submit To Your Ego, You Will Stay Confined To It. Instead, Realize That You Can And Will Be What Your Heart And Soul Desires.
- Focus On Being, Rather Than Reforming.
- You **Don’t** Have To Prove Yourself. Instead, Believe And Affirm.
- In Order To Achieve Something, First You Must Become.

---

#### Notes

	We are all playing as characters, and we have the choice consciously too choose what that character is. Take some time too think about who you want too be and write it down. Then, embody that person as if you already are that person. How would this version of me think? How would this version of me respond to this situation? Dont focus on reforming because you are creating more problems than needed. Finally, feel it to be true, for feelings are the way you respond to your subconscious, and your subconscious is what makes this a reality.

### The Magician's Way

![](TheMagiciansWay.jpg)

**"When You Go For Things In Life, Nothing Will Change Until The Underrying Structure  
Changes"**

---

### The Mirror Principle

![](themirrorprinciple.jpg)

![](themirrorprinciplecontd.jpg)

---

- The Idea That Your Outer World Is Merely A Reflection Of Your Inner World.
- Most People Try To Manipulate The Reflection. Instead, Influence The Reflection Indirectly By Changing The Image You Present.

---

#### LAW ONE

- The Mirror Reflects Relationship To Self And World.
	- If You Believe You're Not Good Enough, The Mirror Will Reflect This.
- The Mirror Will Always Confirm What You Believe To Be True About Your Identity And Paradigms.

##### Interrupt The Pattern

**Form Your Identity and Paradigms**

- Write Your Self-Views
- Write Your Paradigms

**Believe These To Be True!**

---

#### LAW TWO

**The Reflection Is Formed With Delay**

- Stay with your assumption long enough to manifest.


---

#### LAW THREE

**The Mirror Of Reality Does Not Reflect The Nature Of Your Thoughts, But The Pure Content Of It.**

- I.E. "'I Hate My Job" Will Result In More Things To Piss You Off In Your Job
- Glass Half Full


---

##### Notes

	This right here is how you apply what I wrote above. Instead of continuing too give in too old beliefs and ideas about life that bring you down, you use this to form your thoughts and beliefs that help you. For example, if you have the firm belief that something always stressed you out, change your thought too, “this is easy and I handle it with zero problems”. You have to feel it to be true however, and the greatest way is to catch yourself in a old belief and thought, step back and change that thought and feeling.

### The Power of Your Subconcious

---

### You Are What You Think About

![](URWhatUThinkAbout.jpg)

## Decisions

---

	I really want to write to inspire, I want to be known for something positive, someone who was able to help others who are going through some bad shit. 
	
	For the last few years, I've been consumed with so much negativity and during that time I was unable to see the good things and the effects I had on people around me, most of all my children. 
	
	I wish I had gotten myself out of that situation years ago, but I was so convinced I could change the situation's outcome. 
	
	Towards the end of that relationship I was changing, I was becoming a better man by acknowledging my flaws and my mistakes, but sometimes it's just too late to save something that was always doomed from the start. 
	
	Life can be so hard sometimes, especially when we are the ones who choose to make decisions that can come back and bite us in the ass.

## Endings

---

	Endings are hard, life-changing, and sometimes life-ending.  
	I think it's safe to say I'll never be the same person I was before 2017.  
	
	Dreams were shattered, love was broken, and hope was lost. That fear of monsters being real as a child came to life, except that those monsters never came from under the bed or out of the closet, they disguised themselves in human form.  
	
	They became the reason I never slept, they got in my head and made me question my self-worth. They made me believe I would never be anything and I'd never be happy again. They made me question my own life every day until I started becoming one of them myself.  
	
	My whole life I lived by a set of standards and morals so that I would never cross over to the dark side. I had boundaries and lines that I would never cross to keep me safe from being the next Anakin Skywalker and now I understand exactly why he became Darth Vader because when people you love, fuck you up and show you a side of themselves and life that you never thought was real, it creates a catastrophic chain of events inside your belief system and in the foundation you've built your life upon.  
	
	Love turned into pain, the pain turned into hate and hate turned into feeling nothing.  
	What I've learned, is that Hate is not the greatest negative emotion, feeling nothing is. If you hate something it's for a reason, a purpose, but to feel nothing and do things that hurt people for no reason, for no purpose, you can really fuck the world up, and far too many of us feel nothing anymore.  
	
	For a long time, I balanced myself on all the lines that I swore I would never cross, and then one by one I didn't care anymore, and after every line I crossed, that structure and foundation of who I once was started caving in.  
	
	Wall after wall, floor after floor, until it buried me underneath it and it wasn't until the basement collapsed that I realized there is no rock bottom, there's no bottom at all to the holes we dig for ourselves, it's never-ending and you can just keep going until the consequences of your actions and choices catch up to you and either kill you or mentally impair you.

## Glad To Exist

---

**2021-08-24 7:37 AM**

>Happy to be here, thankful that others continued to see the things within me that I could not see in myself. Humbled that I got another chance to rewrite my story so it can be told in a more positive way someday. That's what's important, that's what matters, I didn't let my pain and struggles define me, I let them teach me that there's always a better way and that every mountain can be climbed if you just keep going.

## Grow Through Your Changes

---

**2014-04-11-081200**

> If you must change, change for the better. Don't change into someone you will grow to hate just to accommodate the person who claims to care about you. Some peoples genetics were infused with too much negativity. You could paint a canvas of all the great things they have in life and surround them with it and the only thing they will notice is how crooked the easel is or that the paint dripped onto the carpet.

## Happiness In DNA

---

	Happiness is much like DNA, it's different for everyone. What makes you happy may not be the same guidelines that make others happy. To me, happiness is something that should not be felt 100% of the time, if you are never sad or angry then how do you know you are happy? 
	
	Happiness should be a reminder of all the things you love and that make you smile but not something that should stick around long enough that you forget to appreciate its value. Instead, you can choose to always be grateful. If you believe that money or medicine or a new relationship will make you find happiness, then you will always be looking for more money, more doctors, or more people. 
	
	We are all capable of being happy, the key is to define it yourself and to be grateful for the things you have even after all of your misfortunes. That's a start anyways

---

## Happy

---

>Happiness is not a place somewhere that you have to climb mountains and obstacles to get to, nor is it something that 99 you can only get from other people or the people you love. It's a decision you make every day. You have to understand that your unhappiness comes from continuing to make the decision to keep doing things that aren't good for your soul. Nobody is responsible for your own happiness but you, do what's good for you at all costs. Life is short and death is an open door waiting for you to walk through at any given moment.

---

## Light Absorption

---

>There was a period of time, somewhere between early 2017 to early 2020 where shit got really dark. I didn't things would ever get better, Most days I didn't want to get out and I really wished I would fade out of existence. It was just after my son's 15th Birthday last year when I told myself and my mom that I'm going to get a job and out of my room and I'm going to make my life better. What I can say now is, somewhere in that darkness I found a light and that light grows brighter every day.

## No Grey Area

**2015-04-23-111200**

- Are you guided by passion or by corruption? Are you the person you want to be or did you become who you are because you follow what others wanted for you instead?  
- Do you believe in change, or do you live ignorantly based oﬀ of the false assumptions those before you had?  
- These are questions you should stop and ask yourself because the answers to either side of these questions deﬁne who you are and who you have been.  
- Only after giving some thought to them will you be able to change who you will become.

## Passenger

---

**2020-10-31-042139**

>One thing I've come to realize the most is that our inner demons aren't there to hurt us, they're there to hurt all the people that love us, they take them out one by one until it's just you and them and then they become you. I see it all around me, even in myself. So much darkness, so much anger, so much misunderstanding and all that does is bring those demons to life. They are awakened from hibernation by their surroundings, by the trauma, the environment, anxiety, bad relationships, and anything that is negative. You don't have to come from a broken home, you don't have to be abused as a child, and they don't just come out because of your childhood, I think that a lot of them probably stem from your childhood but they thrive more in your adulthood because you no longer have that innocence you had as a child to protect you. We are all born with the sense of wrong and right and the ability to be good or bad. It all comes down to a choice, a line drawn between the light and the darkness and once you cross that line you better distance yourself from everyone who cares about you because you've just become a ticking time bomb to all of them, but of course, it's too late for that cause that good part of you is now permanently in the passenger seat while your demons come to life.  

---

## Punches

---

>Just a reminder that life isn't about what's happened to you, it's about how you pick yourself up and keep going. We are NOT defined by our past, our struggles, or trauma. We are defined by what we choose to do with those things today and in the future. There's always a choice in everything we do and the sooner you accept the responsibility for those choices, the sooner you can grow and move forward

---

## The Bright Sides

---

>Do all things with love and passion, keep moving forward through the pain, through the rain, through every mountain in your way. Those are the things I'm reminded of every time I think about my father. It's what keeps me motivated and what keeps me in check when I'm not living the way he had shown. me. It's never too late to change, it's never too late to outgrow the people who don't bring the same positive energy in your life as you do and that includes family. Your might be connected by blood but there are people out there who are bonded to you by real love, people who will go to war and fight your demons with you. Instead of using them to hurt you. People who won't abandon you when you feel like giving up. People who still continue to show up even when it's inconvenient. People who don't want anything from you but your company.

---

## The Truth Is

---

- You never really heal from certain traumas.
	- They become a part of you forever.
- The only hope is that you don't become the people that hurt you.
	- It's not fair that they did what they did to you, but it's more unfair that you cause someone else the same trauma just because it was done to you.
- Know the difference.
	- Break the cycle or the cycle keeps repeating.
		- Year after year,
			- Generation to generation.

## What Is Love

---

>What is love? To me, love isn't just waking up next to you and smiling at your beautiful face first thing in the morning. Love is looking up to see somebody who cares about you with everything they have even when you're mess and hard to be around isn't just about happiness it's about commitment, it's about sacrifice, it's pain, frustration, irritability, love is about doing whatever it takes to put a smile on your lover space when they can't seem to smile at all. Love is more than just a four letter word, it's more that just something you say to somebody you care about it's that feeling you get deep down in your soul when you would give up everything even your own soul save the person you care about. It's about fighting for what you want the most, it's about being patient and setting your own pride aside even when you believe you're right in certain situations. Love is what makes us all better, it's the wind in our sails, the will to keep going on days when you feel like giving up the most. Love is staying up all through the night being disappointed in yourself for the way you reacted during conversation. Love is Beautiful.Love Is You it's something you feel deep down in your soul when you're lost inside your mind and you feel trapped and empty

## Write to Inspire

---

**2017-06-18**

	I really want to write to inspire, I want to be known for something positive, someone who was able to help others who are going through some badshit.
	
	For the last few years, I've been consumed with so much negativity and during that time I was unable to see not only the good things but the effects I had on people around me, most of all my children.  
	
	I wish I had gotten myself out of that situation years ago, but I was so convinced I could change the situation outcome.  
	
	Towards the end of that relationship I was changing, I was becoming a better man by acknowledging my flaws and my mistakes, but sometimes it's just too late to save something that was always doomed from the start.  
	
	Life can be so hard sometimes, especially when we are the ones who choose to make decisions that can come back and bite us in the ass.
