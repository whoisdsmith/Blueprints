Like my aunt Jessie's telling me these times are like she's prayed for money like to pay off rent.
Someone gets her money out of nowhere like...
It's kind of crazy.
But yeah I really like...
Which one is it?
I read like four of them.
Four of them?
I like this part.
This was my...
This is my favorite one.
You know?
And it also says like your assumptions like it says don't question probability.
You know you have to drop all your mental limitations.
You just have to believe and feel it to be true in your imagination because you're subconscious.
That is what makes everything happen.
Okay.
Yeah.
All right dad.
This is the test.
So do I have a mental illness?
No.
Probably to people who don't have open minds.
It's crazy to believe you know.
I wouldn't expect anybody to believe it.
But at the same time from my experiences...
Shit.
Do you go on letters all the time?
I mean occasionally.
But like I don't know.
I learned from early on like...
Never really pick sides for anything.
You know?
So like I always try and be as non-judgmental as possible and to keep an open mind.
Right.
I think it's really the people who refuse to come out of that closed mind thinking are the people that hold us back and really you know if what they believe is truly wrong then you know everybody that they love or that loves them are fucking doomed.
Right.
You know?
And yeah just like thinking about like shit were made from stars.
You know that?
And stars will.
And like there's so much crazy things but we get so caught up in survival and our anxieties and like we don't really understand how miraculous it is to not only be alive.
And we're just focused on that.
We're focused on what our ego is telling us because our ego is needed in order to survive.
However it definitely holds us back you know in terms of only thinking from you know how people think of me, how much power I have.
You know we're so caught up in this.
You know this seems like a fallacy.
But you know people truly underestimate how powerful our subconscious mind is.
You know what I mean?
And I think even if you don't believe in that what I would do because what's been helping me a lot is thinking about your self-concept which is basically like who you are as an individual you know dropping all these limiting beliefs like you don't deserve these things.
Like you deserve everything honestly if you truly think about it.
I think.
And you just have to just go within your parameters and decide what you truly desire.
Not what your ego desires because your ego all egos you know want power.
But like when you truly think from like if none of that mattered if everybody had all the money and the fame and the cars and the wealth all the food on the table like all the food on the table and then you think like if this was just normal for me what else is what I desire?
And what do I desire?
Do I desire to help people?
Do I desire to make a change?
You know do I desire to live the life of my dreams you know doing crazy things?
I think that's what you should pursue.
And obviously you have to get your life set up straight you know.
It's a good thing to be hard working.
It's not a good thing to overwork and over exhaust yourself because one of my very first things when getting into this is like you have to kind of you have to be selfish in a spiritual way.
Like stop giving stop entertaining ideas or you know stop entertaining things that only bring you down.
And you know a crazy thing is too is like if you think about this like we are arguing and we're talking to people within our mind all the time.
Scientifically proven.
You know so if you're continuing to dwell on past events or future anxieties and recreating these scenes your brain is going to have you react in a way that aligns with it.
You know what I mean?
Like if you're worried and you're stressed and you think that that stress is bad for you and all you can think about is worrying and not succeeding you know most likely.
Yeah.
That's how it's going to end up.
Exactly.
It's not all the time.
You know sometimes you have a sense of yourself that thinks it can succeed and then it's like kind of torn like you're on both sides kind of in and out like you know you can succeed but you're just worried you know.
But it is crazy.
Yeah.
What are your honest thoughts on it?
On that?
Yeah.
I mean I like it a lot better in the actual Bible.
Like I think it's more I'd rather believe that than the shit in the Bible.
It makes more sense if you really think about it like because the shit was written so long ago times are so different but if you look at it from a basic starting point of human beings as a guideline a guide through life.
Yeah.
Basically my brain's not working right now but like I love it.
I think you're honest.
Yeah and you know I'm going to test it out and you know it's not just merely wishful thinking it's not like you just think happy thoughts and then you know that's it.
It's about you know changing the state of who you are because you can think these happy thoughts all day long but if you're still persisting in the same state of mind oh my life sucks you know this is what it's still going to come out of it.
It's not just purely wishful thinking it's changing your actual state of being.
And you know there's a lot of there's science on it too.
If you look up Joe Dispenza he's a quantum physics or something like that and it shows you the like you know what the quantum realm is.
This is what that's pretty much about.
Yeah me and Richard actually talk about this shit all the time.
Really?
Yeah.
So maybe we're all just crazy or.
I don't know because at the same time Big Sean you know what I like about his song so much is that he talks about these same principles in his songs if you listen to him.
Faith of a mustard seed that kept growing and he talks about like imagining it so much he felt like he had it because that's like the biggest thing is if you imagine it and believe it to be real no matter what your senses tell you your subconscious mind will get you to that point.
But if you say I will be there one day then you are prolonging it and it's like obviously you know it takes time in order to make this a reality like if you're trying to be a fucking billionaire or win the fucking lottery so many things have to come in place in order for that to happen.
And the lottery I mean I don't know I wouldn't even want to go to that because why do I why would I want free money for no reason you know like I don't know I want my money like earned like I feel like you know what I mean and I just also kind of feel like that's not something I could actually believe myself to do you know what I mean just honestly like is it all odds you know or is it actually something that you can control I don't know you know what I do know I can control I know it's possible for me to do great things like fucking build a business become an astronaut like I know these are truly possible so that's what I'm going to focus on I don't give a fuck about the lottery I really don't give a fuck about money although I want to be in an abundance of it I don't want to have to worry about it I want to have enough to where I can experience life but I'm not interested in flashy things you know I'm interested in building and you know changing people's lives because man there's nothing more like I think I get it from my grandpa because you know how you know.
Bill.
Bill yeah.
He will easily shirt off his back for anybody and I've kind of definitely adopted that because you know that's how I want to affect people and so if I have to recreate this into you know a more believable standpoint if you know what I'm saying to get people to practice these kind of things if it ends up working for me because obviously man who's going to believe this shit you know what I mean so if I can build in a way that they're able to practice these same things and at least to change their self-concept of who they are which allows them to live a better life because when you change who you are like I'm disciplined I am you know.
Joyful I am you know excited for life you know I don't let obstacles I don't focus on the obstacles I focus on my goals that's the biggest thing about this I like too is that I've dropped the importance of problems and my most important the most important thing to me is the end result that you know what I'm gonna figure these problems out I'm not gonna let them emotionally toll on me because if I allow that my the problems to do that guess what's gonna keep showing up guess what's gonna continue to drain my energy guess what's gonna take my attention from my goal it's gonna be the problem and so there's gonna be more problems I'm gonna be in an attitude of man these problems really fucking suck and so then I'm gonna end up giving up I'm gonna end up you know let's try something else you know instead of doing or pursuing what I really want to pursue because I'm just so entrenched entrenched in these problems so if nothing else I know now to you know focus on who I want to be and believe it to be real focus on my end goal you know it's as simple as that yeah I mean it's pretty amazing but I just have this feeling that you know like ever since that Friday like and you can ask everybody I could call T Young right now that Monday morning I was like we're not having school like I was making all these jokes was like Mr. Dent's got us you know we're not having school and then that full around that Friday maybe it wasn't the way I exactly pictured not having school I was thinking more of like a snow day but guess what I still didn't have fucking school so you know shit just just some food for thought yeah make a book out of it and send it to me I don't know if I'm gonna make a book but I'll show you everything that you know that I find important or useful but yeah I I think you know what you should do I think you should go to sleep tonight and just think about climbing a ladder and visions you can get to climb the ladder but that's probably not believable because you said you do it like how occasional I mean a couple times a year not like often often no maybe two three times a year hey try it tonight try it tonight try it and it'll it'll take three nights so you're sufficient like you have to truly believe yourself ladder you know
