# Thankful

---


	I wanted to say I am so thankful for each and every one of you who have helped me get through the upside down. Seriously never imagined I could leave for 6 years and come back and there would still be people that give a shit about me. I was willing to accept that I was always going to have one person who would be there for me until the end, I wish I had done things different, but there's no point in going back. 
	
	I've always had this obsession with time travel and fixing my past mistakes but I've finally grown up enough to realize it's better to learn from my mistakes than to waste the time and effort into trying to fix them. I don't know if I'd even be here right now if it weren't for you guys. 3 weeks ago I wanted to drive into a tree because my wife made me feel like no one ever gave a shit about me when she was the one who really didn't give a shit. I know I've got long ways to go before I'm back to being myself again but without this support system I would have never believed that my life could go on. 
	
	I can not stress it enough when I say never let a relationship change you in ways you can't come back from. If you can't be yourself when you're with the person who is suppose to love you than get the fuck out right now because not all of us are as fortunate to have so many people that care and not all of us will make it out alive. One day at a time, both feet forward and stop making time to look behind you. 
	
	Everything in your rearview is there for a reason and that reason is to move on to better and more positive things and people. People who want to love you and help you grow. That's all I want. I know my self worth and I know what I deserve, I wish I would've stood up for myself years ago, but I didn't and now the only thing I can only change is what's in front of me and which path I want to go. 
	
	I was pretty sure this marriage was going to destroy my outlook on life and on love, but than I remembered we are all different and not everyone is hell bent on destroying your life. So Thank you again to those who have been here to help me down the right path. I fucking love you guys.
